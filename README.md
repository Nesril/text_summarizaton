# Extractive Summarization: 
an approach that selects the most important phrases and lines from the documents. It then combines all the important lines to create the summary. So, in this case, every line and word of the summary actually belongs to the original document which is summarized.

In extractive summarization, the goal is to select the most salient and relevant phrases or sentences from the source document and combine them to create a summary. Unlike abstractive summarization, where the summary may contain new words or phrases not present in the source document, extractive summarization strictly relies on extracting and rearranging existing content from the original text.

The extractive approach identifies important lines or sentences based on various criteria such as word frequency, sentence position, or similarity to the overall document. These important lines are then concatenated to form the summary. Since the extracted lines are directly taken from the original document, every word and phrase in the summary can be traced back to the source document.

Extractive summarization aims to preserve the factual information and context of the original document. It can be an effective approach for generating summaries that faithfully represent the key points of the source material. However, extractive methods may sometimes result in summaries that lack coherence or fail to capture the overall meaning of the document, especially when dealing with longer texts or documents with complex structures.
